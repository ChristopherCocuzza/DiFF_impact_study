# DiFF_impact_study

Repository for performing impact studies on DiFFs and transversity PDFs.

* <ins>baseline</ins>: This folder contains the baseline replicas from [our latest paper][paper].  They are contained in the folder msr.

* <ins>analysis</ins>: This folder contains the code used to analyze the replicas.  This includes doing predictions, plotting data vs. theory, and plotting the distributions.


* <ins>driver.py</ins>: Running driver.py <wdir> will analyze the replicas using the codes in the analysis folder.  Doing so also requires [Diffpack][Diffpack].

* <ins>pseudo.xlsx</ins>: 

* <ins>sim.py</ins>:
